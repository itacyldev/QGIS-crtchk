<p>CartoDruid is an Android application developed at the Agrarian Technological Institute of Castilla
    and Le;n (ITACyL) designed as a support tool for field work tasks, that aims to solve the problem of using
    geographic information outside the office in a disconnected environment.</p>
<p>The main goal of the tool is to allow users to collect data quickly and easily with the minimum knowledge of
    geographic systems and be open enough to be integrated within the workflow of the user organization.</p>
<p>For the latter, ITACyL provides synchronization services in the cloud to share a common view of data across
    different devices. The synchronization process is based on the exchange between client and server of a
    SQLite-Spatialite database, the data sent in the SQLite tables are incorporated into the remote DB incrementally,
    and in response, the client receives a copy of the DB that includes new changes sent by other devices.</p>
<p>This synchronization system is open by request, if you are interested, please contact us through our forum at
    <a href="foro.cartodruid.es">foro.cartodruid.es</a> to configure your workspace. </p>
<p>In this same forum there is information and posts about how to get the most of the tool and you can consult us any
    question about the CartoDruid or how to integrate it into your project.</p>
